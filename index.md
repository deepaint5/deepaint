# Welcome to Our Senior Design Project

During the last decade, social media applications have become widely used and part of our daily lives due to the easy accessibility of mobile devices and the increasing quality of their cameras. All around the world, people take photos constantly and share them on social media. While sharing photos, people have an urge to get rid of the imperfections in the photo such as a stranger in the background of a selfie or a car in a beautiful scene.  Moreover, many want their photos to be more artistic than the real version; therefore, they adjust lighting, change style, etc. 

However, applying these changes requires knowledge and experience in photoshop. A regular person can not achieve to remove an object from a photo in a realistic way. Nevertheless, this became a need for regular people on a daily basis. Therefore, applications that make these adjustments automatically have gained more and more demand.  Those applications with a user-friendly interface, fast modification speed, and low error rate in modification (i.e. more realistic results) are preferred by the users. 

Considering the demand for easy and accurate photoshop applications, we came up with the DeePaint project.
